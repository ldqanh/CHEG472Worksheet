# CHEG472Worksheet
Week 1
Description:
This Jupyter notebook contains introductory-level data analysis. It covers fundamental data science techniques, such as data loading, basic exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization. The primary focus is on getting familiar with Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze data distributions and visual patterns.

Week 2
Description:
This second notebook builds on the basics and dives deeper into data preprocessing and feature engineering. It introduces techniques for handling missing values, data transformation, and encoding categorical variables. Additional EDA steps provide a deeper understanding of the data and prepare it for more advanced model training tasks.

Week 3
Description:
This Python script contains code for training and evaluating machine learning models. Here, youâ€™ll see implementations of supervised learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, or support vector machines. The script focuses on the machine learning workflow, including data splitting, model training, and performance evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

Week 4
Description:
This advanced Python script includes a more complex machine learning project, likely involving multiple models and techniques such as hyperparameter tuning or model ensembling. It might also implement cross-validation and feature scaling, aiming for higher performance in predictive accuracy. This script represents a culmination of the methods learned, combining them into a more refined and optimized model.
